# Shanghai Azures Underwater Hockey beginner training plan

### Week 1 第一周

This session could be split into 2 groups after 1 hour depending on the level of players. That is some people won't make it to the bottom after one hour while some will.
这期课程，一个小时之后就可以分开两组因为会有一些人能到水底潜水，也有不能的。

Explain before playing hockey, we need to master basic swimming skills, so we might not play hockey during this session, depending on people's level. 给初学者介绍现需要知道一些简单游泳技巧。所以肯定在这期不会玩水曲。

* Getting used to the snorkel 习惯用呼吸管
* Fin swimming 泳蹼
* Simple diving (pick up the puck at the bottom) 潜水
